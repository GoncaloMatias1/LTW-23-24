            <li>Former mayor of Caminha, Miguel Alves, and businesswoman Manuela Sousa were acquitted of malfeasance related to public contracting for communication consultancy services.</li>
            <li>Court's Decision: Highlighted the lack of evidence to support the accusation by the Public Prosecutor (MP) against the defendants.</li>
            <li>Miguel Alves faced accusations of violating public contracting rules by agreeing to communication consultancy services with Manuela Sousa without a public procurement process.</li>
            <li>In January, during closing arguments, the MP sought conviction based on documentary evidence and experiential rules, but the court disagreed.</li>
            <li>Post-verdict, Alves spoke on the personal and family impact of the accusations, describing the damage as natural but irreparable.</li>
